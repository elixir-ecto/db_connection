defmodule DBConnection.Ownership do
  @moduledoc """
  A DBConnection pool that requires explicit checkout and checkin
  as a mechanism to coordinate between processes.

  ## Options

    * `:ownership_mode` - When mode is `:manual`, all connections must
      be explicitly checked out before by using `ownership_checkout/2`.
      Otherwise, mode is `:auto` and connections are checked out
      implicitly. `{:shared, owner}` mode is also supported so
      processes are allowed on demand. On all cases, checkins are
      explicit via `ownership_checkin/2`. Defaults to `:auto`.
    * `:ownership_timeout` - The maximum time that a process is allowed to own
      a connection, default `120_000`. This timeout exists mostly for sanity
      checking purposes and can be increased at will, since DBConnection
      automatically checks in connections whenever there is a mode change.
    * `:ownership_log` - The `Logger.level` to log ownership changes, or `nil`
      not to log, default `nil`.

  There are also two experimental options, `:post_checkout` and `:pre_checkin`
  which allows a developer to configure what happens when a connection is
  checked out and checked in. Those options are meant to be used during tests,
  and have the following behaviour:

    * `:post_checkout` - it must be an anonymous function that receives the
      connection module, the connection state and it must return either
      `{:ok, connection_module, connection_state}` or
      `{:disconnect, err, connection_module, connection_state}`. This allows
      the developer to change the connection module on post checkout. However,
      in case of disconnects, the return `connection_module` must be the same
      as the `connection_module` given. Defaults to simply returning the given
      connection module and state.

    * `:pre_checkin` - it must be an anonymous function that receives the
      checkin reason (`:checkin`, `{:disconnect, err}` or `{:stop, err}`),
      the connection module and the connection state returned by `post_checkout`.
      It must return either `{:ok, connection_module, connection_state}` or
      `{:disconnect, err, connection_module, connection_state}` where the connection
      module is the module given to `:post_checkout` Defaults to simply returning
      the given connection module and state.

  ## Callers lookup

  When checking out, the ownership pool first looks if there is a connection
  assigned to the current process and then checks if there is a connection
  assigned to any of the processes listed under the `$callers` process
  dictionary entry. The `$callers` entry is set by default for tasks from
  Elixir v1.8.

  You can also pass the `:caller` option on checkout with a pid and that
  pid will be looked up first, instead of `self()`, and then we fall back
  to `$callers`.
